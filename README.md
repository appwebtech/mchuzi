## Welcome to a Ruby on Rails project by the appwebtech!

I build this generic app just to show how a developer can utilise his full webstack creativity
in an ALL IN ONE environment using Ruby on Rails. 

Rails is a web-application framework that includes everything needed to
create database-backed web applications according to the
[Model-View-Controller (MVC)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller)
pattern.
In Rails, database-backed model classes are derived from
`ActiveRecord::Base`.
This technology is very versatile and thus wouldn't require someone to hire separately a Front-end and a Back-end developer for the 
same job.

It's important however to note that even though the skeleton of the project is on rails, the styling is done with CSS (Actually more Sass than Vanilla).
HTML5 has been used a lot in the index page and in order to render the styling like buttons, etc, Bootstrap has been used. 

There are no downloadable files for Bootstrap in Rails or a CMS script to link online. What I did is;
- I got a gem of bootstrap in the Gemfiles.
- Ran bundle install in Bash
- Had that embedded in my work environment in C9 and was good to go.
- jQuery scripting works great in C9 and no need to code locally running Apache or Gulp with SQL.

Gem file for postgresql are available and thus easy to deploy to Heroku which doesn't support a full stack of SQL-Lite

In Summary, the Technologies employed on this project are the following:

- Ruby on Rails
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap
- jQuery


###### If on C9;
1. Run the project with the "Run Project" button in the menu bar on top of the IDE.
2. Preview your new app by clicking on the URL that appears in the Run panel.

###### Else;

You can open this app with any of the best text-editors like Sublime, Brackets, Atom, Wrangler or Notepad++ (only windows) and run it. 

Other projects on my Github page were done with sublime text and were uploaded in Git via Bash command prompt. In many instances I code locally rather than using a *cloud* platform because I want to have a total interactability with the project I'm creating and want to test from the clients/users perspective; thus, I test UX using assisted technologies and UX & UI in the main browsers available in our lovely planet through a local server, using **Apache or Gulp**. 

Apart from the rails projects, all others can be viewed through the browser after downloading and running index.html.

Have fun reviewing our projects.
