## Welcome to a Ruby on Rails project by theappwebtech!

I built this generic app just to show how a developer can utilise his full webstack creativity
in an ALL IN ONE environment using Ruby on Rails. 
This technology is very versatile and thus wouldn't require someone to hire separately a Front-end and a Back-end developer for the 
same job.

It's important however to note that even though the skeleton of the page is on rails, the styling is done with CSS3.
HTML5 has been used a lot in the index page and in order to render the styling like buttons, etc, Bootstrap has been used. 

There are no downloadable files for Bootstrap in Rails or a CMS script to link online. What I did is;
- I got a gem of bootstrap in the Gemfiles.
- Ran bundle install in Bash
- Had that embedded in my work environment in C9 and was good to go.
- jQuery scripting works great in C9 and no need to code locally running Apache or Gulp with SQL.

Gem file for postgresql are available and thus easy to deploy to Heroku which doesn't support a full stack of SQL-Lite

In Summary, the Technologies employed on this project are the following:

- Ruby on Rails
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap
- jQuery



1. Run the project with the "Run Project" button in the menu bar on top of the IDE if on C9.
2. Preview your new app by clicking on the URL that appears in the Run panel below (https://threshing-josembi.c9users.io/).

You can test this code on many environments: The code for this project was purely done online in cloud 9 at 
this url. https://ide.c9.io!

Other projects on my Github page were done with sublime text and were run through a local server, using Apache or Gulp. 

Apart from the rails projects, all others can be viewed through the browser after downloading and running index.html.

Have fun reviewing our projects.
